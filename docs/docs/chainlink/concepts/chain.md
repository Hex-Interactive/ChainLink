# Chain

Chain is a simplistic scripting language. It's how you add custom logic and behaviors to maps, by utilizing the features of the language itself alongside [Actions](../actions) and [Routines](../routines). Chain can be used as a standalone feature in game development, but ChainLink is a runtime for Chain that provides helpful abstractions which map developers can make use of.

You can learn more about how to use and work with Chain in its documentation [HERE](/docs/chain).

# Usage in ChainLink

Chain is primarily used to execute [Actions](../actions) and [Routines](../routines) in a certain order. In many places throughout the system of ChainLink, there is an available space to put a "Chain script" for execution, typically whenever something is activated.
