# Chain

Chain is a custom list-based scripting language. It's intentionally simple, lacking common programming features such as if-statements or functions. The singluar goal of Chain is to be a list of definitive instructions to execute. Achieving more complex logic with Chain comes from the usage of features like Links, [Actions](actions), and [Routines](routines).

## Supported Datatypes

At the moment, Chain supports the `string`, `boolean`, and `number` datatypes from Luau.
