# Introduction

Chain is a simplistic scripting language designed around flexibility of its implementation. The primary way to use Chain is with [ChainLink](/docs/chainlink), but it can be used without it for any other purposes a game may need with a runtime scripting language.

See the sidebar for information on specifics aspects of Chain!
